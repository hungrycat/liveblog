todo's:
	-events listing page
		+ should not retrieve the posts or comments
	-event live page
	

	-user accounts
		+manage users
		+username goes on posts
	-avatars for users
	-upload images in a post (add image button)

	-Watch event page
		+view events
		+make comments - generates a commenter id number
		+make a name for yourself 
		+add an image
		+see posted comments with blockquote formatting
	-edit comments
	-add comment to stream with blockquote formatting, inline response
	-ignore commenter
	-edit event title


	-set up server
		+upgrade to express 4.0? http://scotch.io/bar-talk/expressjs-4-0-new-features-and-upgrading-from-3-0
		+make embed event url point to the right place
	-domain name - readitlive.net or .org

	-number of users online, max users for event, etc

	-rather than fetching data, live event page should be getting a stream of posts and comments
		+but should load images in the stream only once
	-offload posts to something with less overhead, maybe a json on a different server instance - or two with a load balancer in front

Nice to have:
	-change new post to use the xeditable thing, it looks much better. 
	-hide the delete button when editing posts: http://vitalets.github.io/angular-xeditable/#text-btn
	-event live/not live changes button color
	-use nicer looking confirm dialouge

design doc for the livebloging platform

Backend - REST API only
	Events
		contains posts
		contains comments
	Every time the posts are updated a new json file is put on s3



	S3 setup:
		entire event, minus comments, sent to event.json - how often updated? 
			every 30 seconds or so? or every time a new post is made?
		check a "status.json" file to see if the event is live. If it is:
			check recent.json every 3 seconds or so. This contains the ~50 most recent posts. 





Front:
One SPA with two views? or two SPA's?: the admin pages, and the view page. 


admin/
	Shows list of events in chronological order
	button to create new event
	link to get embed code for each
	link to admin page for each

admin/event/[eventid]
	admin page has the blog, 
	and below it a place to make an entry. 
		Possibly post now/queue setup
	On the right side is a list of user comments.
		You can edit the comments and post them. 
		you can click on a user and it will block them. 
	see number of users online (express guide has an example)
	

View /event/[eventid]
	page has just the posts, and a box at the bottom for username and comments. 
	will need some design about logging in, etc. 
	It should be embedded as an i-frame linking to the /event/eventid
