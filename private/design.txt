	-avatars for users
		+ option to detele avatar or upload something new

	-different level users - admin, viewer

	-Read page

Nice to have:

	- confirm when deleting things
	- tap events
	- uploaded images rotation
	- inline response to comments
	- on mobile, comment is a button which shows a full page text box
	- edit event title
	- ownership of events
